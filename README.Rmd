# planteam

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of planteam is to facilitate the development of the annual SAFE summaries using .Rmd files to produce a word doc - that will likely be hosted on google docs for edits. 
Additionally, this package can be used to generate catch reports (for off-cycle assessments) and the specs tables used by the AKRO. 
Since all of these products are supposed to be pulling from the same data source this will hopefully eliminate copy & paste errors.

See the [planteam webpage articles](https://afsc-assessments.github.io/planteam/) for more information.
