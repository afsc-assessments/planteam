# planteam

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of planteam is to facilitate the development of the annual summary using .Rmd files to produce a word doc - that will likely be hosted on google docs for edits.

## Installation

You can install the development version of planteam from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("afsc-assessments/planteam")
```

## Example

Once `planteam` is installed on your machine open a new .Rmd file, click on
the “From Template” find the one that is called `goa_summary`, or `bsai_summary` name it **goa_summary** or **bsai_summary** - *example links won't work otherwise* - and the suite of .Rmd files will be placed in the folder. 

```{r, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('man', 'figures', 'README-template.PNG'))
```

Go to either the `bsai_summary.Rmd` or `goa_summary.Rmd` file and press the `knit` button in Rstudio.
The specs data will be stored in the data folder, you will need both the September and Novemeber tables. 
Additionally authors will need to fill in the biomass spreadsheet.
