## 7. Arrowtooth flounder

Status and catch specifications (t) of arrowtooth flounder in recent years. 
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year. The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2` are those recommended by the Plan Team. 
Catch data are current through `r catch_data_date`.

*Changes from the previous assessment*  
In accordance with the approved schedule, this is an off-year for arrowtooth flounder and a partial
assessment was conducted. A full stock assessment will be conducted in 2022. There were no changes in
the assessment methodology. Changes in the input data include:
1. Updated 2020 catch estimate of 10,681 t.
2. Estimates of catch through October 30, 2021 of 8,698 t.
3. To estimate future catches, the “yield ratio” (the average of the catch/ABC ratio from 2016-2020)
was updated to 0.13, which was then multiplied by the future ABCs.

*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
The projected age 1+ total biomass for 2022 is 921,690 t, which is roughly the same as the 921,074 t
projected for 2022 in last year’s assessment. The projected female spawning biomass for 2022 is 509,672
t, which is a slight increase from last year’s 2022 estimate of 509,208 t. Overall stock trends remain fairly
stable.

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*  
The SSC has determined that reliable estimates of B40%, F40%, and F35% exist for this stock. Arrowtooth
flounder therefore qualifies for management under Tier 3. The point estimates of B40% and F40% from this
year’s assessment are 223,530 t and 0.135. The projected 2022 spawning biomass is well above B40%, so
ABC and OFL recommendations for 2022 were calculated under sub-tier “a” of Tier 3. The authors
recommend setting FABC at the F40% level, which is the maximum permissible level under Tier 3a, resulting
in 2022 and 2023 ABCs of 80,389 t and 83,389 t, respectively. Projected harvesting at F35% (0.160) gives
2022 and 2023 OFLs of 94,445 t and 97,944 t respectively. 

*Status determination*  
Arrowtooth flounder is a lightly exploited stock in the BSAI. Arrowtooth flounder is not being subjected
to overfishing, is not overfished, and is not approaching an overfished condition.
