The goal of `planteam` is to facilitate the developement of the annual summary using .Rmd files to
produce a word doc - that will likely be hosted on google docs for edits.

## Installation

You can install the development version of safe from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("afsc-assessments/planteam")
```

## Example

Once `planteam` is installed on your machine open a new .Rmd file, click on
the “From Template” find the one that is called `goa_summary`, name it *goa_summary* 
and the suite of .Rmd files will be placed in the folder.
