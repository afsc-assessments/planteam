## 1. Walleye pollock


Status and catch specifications (t) of pollock and projections for `r year+1` and `r year+2`. 
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year (age 3+ for W/C/WYAK and survey biomass for SEO). 
The OFL and ABC for 2022 and 2023 are those recommended by the Plan Team. Catch data were through November 6th, 2021. 
The GOA-wide and W/C/WYAK ABCs listed in this table are before reductions for the Prince William Sound GHL. 
However, the federal TACs from earlier years reflect reductions from the ABC due to State waters GHL. 
State waters GHL was computed as 2.5% of the total W/C/WYAK ABC.
