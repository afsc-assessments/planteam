## 1. Walleye pollock

Status and catch specifications (t) of walleye pollock in recent years.
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year. 
The biomass is reported as age 3+ for eastern Bering Sea, age 2+ for the Aleutian Islands and the survey biomass for Bogoslof, as reported in the respective assessments. 
Status and catch specifications (t) of pollock and projections for `r year+1` and `r year+2`. 
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year (age 3+ for W/C/WYAK and survey biomass for SEO). 
The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2` are those recommended by the Plan Team. 
Catch data were through `r catch_data_date`.

### Eastern Bering Sea pollock

*Changes from the previous assessment*  
New data in this year’s assessment include the following:

1. Observer data for catch-at-age and average weight-at-age from the 2020 fishery were finalized and
included.
2. Total catch as reported by NMFS Alaska Regional office was updated and included through 2021.
3. VAST estimates of the combined EBS and NBS survey biomass index were updated and included
through 2021.
4. The AVO index for 2021 was included.
5. Length composition from the 2021 fishery and a preliminary estimate of the age composition from
the 2021 fishery were included.
The authors’ and Team’s recommended model for setting harvest specifications is Model 20.0c, which is a
minor modification of last year’s model (20.0a) in that, in addition to the typical data updates, it includes
fishery length composition and preliminary fishery age composition data from the current year.


*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
Spawning biomass in 2008 was at the lowest level since 1980 but had increased by a factor of 2.30 by 2017,
and has since started trending downward again. The 2008 low was the result of extremely poor recruitments
from the 2002-2005 year classes. 
Recent increases were fueled by recruitment from the very strong 2008, 2012, and 2013 year classes (above average by factors of 2.10, 1.93, and 2.04 for the post-1976 time series, respectively), along with spawning exploitation rates at or below 20% from 2008 through 2018. Spawning biomass is projected to be 15% below $B_{MSY}$ in 2022.

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*  
The SSC has determined that EBS pollock qualifies for management under Tier 1 because there are reliable
estimates of $B_{MSY}$ and the probability density function for $F_{MSY}$. 
The updated estimate of BMSY from the present assessment is 2.220 million t. Projected spawning biomass for 2022 is 1.881 million t, placing EBS walleye pollock in sub-tier “b” of Tier 1. 
As has been the approach for many years, the maximum permissible ABC harvest rate was based on the ratio between MSY and the equilibrium biomass corresponding to MSY. 
The harmonic mean of this ratio from the present assessment, after adjusting according to the sloping portion of the harvest control rule, is 0.334. 
The harvest ratio of 0.334 is multiplied by the geometric mean of the projected fishable biomass for 2022 (3.750 million t) to obtain the maximum permissible ABC for 2022, which is 1.251 million t. 
However, as with other recent EBS pollock assessments, the authors recommend setting ABCs well below the maximum permissible levels. 
Their reasons for doing so are listed in the “ABC Recommendation” section of the SAFE chapter, where all
categories in the risk table are scored as Level 2 (“substantially increased concern”). 
The authors conclude that these levels of concern warrant setting the 2022 and 2023 ABCs at 1,111,000 t and 1,289,000 t (reductions of 11% from the corresponding maxABC in both cases), which are the values associated with the Tier 2 maxABC harvest control rule (use of the Tier 2 rule was suggested by the SSC at the October 2021 meeting). 
This is a change from the harvest policy that has been recommended by both the Team and SSC for the EBS pollock stock since the 2014 assessment cycle, which was to base the reduction on the Tier 3 maxABC harvest control rule. As the authors note, the ratio between the maxABC values resulting from the Tier 1 and Tier 2 harvest control rules is likely to be much less variable than the ratio between the Tier 1 and Tier 3 values. 
The authors also note that the Tier 2 maxABC for 2022 is extremely close to the value that would be obtained by maintaining fishing effort at the current level, which is another strategy that has been used by the Team in the past. 
The Team concurs with the authors’ recommendation to base ABC for the 2022 and 2023 fisheries on the Tier 2 maxABC harvest control rule.

The OFL harvest ratio under Tier 1b is 0.392, corresponding to the arithmetic mean of the ratio between
MSY and the equilibrium fishable biomass corresponding to MSY, after adjusting according to the sloping
portion of the harvest control rule. 
The product of this ratio and the geometric mean of the projected fishable biomass for 2022 determines the OFL for 2022, which is 1.469 million t. 
Given a projected 2022 catch of 1.200 million t, the current projection for OFL in 2023 is 1.704 million t.

*Status determination*  
The walleye pollock stock in the EBS is not being subjected to overfishing, is not overfished, and is not
approaching an overfished condition.


### Aleutian Islands pollock

*Changes from the previous assessment*  
There were no changes made to the assessment model inputs since this was an off-cycle year. New data
added to the projection model included an updated 2020 catch estimate (3,205 t) and new catch estimates
for 2021. The 2022 catch was set at the 3 year average for 2018-2020 of 2,243 t. There were no changes
in assessment methodology since this was an off-cycle year.

*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
Last year’s assessment estimated that spawning biomass reached a minimum level of about $B_{27\%}$ in 2010, but has increased every year since, reaching a level of about B49% in 2020, with a slight projected decline to about $B_{46\%}$ for 2021.
Although nearly all of the cohorts spawned after 2008 have tended to be stronger than nearly all of the cohorts spawned between 1994 and 2008, and the 2011-2015 cohorts are all above the median value, there have been no above-average cohorts spawned since 1989 (the average is much
higher than the median, due to the fact that the 1978 year class was larger than the average of the other
year classes by a factor of about 16.7).

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*  
The official total catch for 2020 is 3,205 t which is a small fraction of the 2020 OFL of 66,973 t;
therefore, the stock is not being subjected to overfishing. The estimates of spawning biomass for 2021
and 2022 from last year’s assessment model (Barbeaux et al. 2020) and the current year (2021) projection
model are 89,906 t and 85,785 t, respectively. The 2021 estimate from the current year projection is above
B35% at 64,916 t and the 2022 estimate is above ½ B35% and the stock is expected to be above B35% in 2033
under projection Scenario 7, therefore, the stock is not currently overfished nor approaching an overfished
condition.

For the 2022 fishery, the Team recommends the maximum allowable ABC of 50,752 t and OFL of 61,263
t from the updated projection model. Projections assumed estimated catches of 1,656 t for 2021 and 2,243
t for 2022, the three-year average (2018- 2020), used in place of maximum permissible ABC.

*Status determination*  
The walleye pollock stock in the Aleutian Islands is not being subject to overfishing, is not currently
overfished, nor is it approaching a condition of being overfished. 

### Bogoslof pollock 

In accordance with the approved schedule, no assessment was conducted for Bogoslof pollock this
year. However, a full stock assessment will be conducted in 2022. Until then, the values generated
from the previous stock assessment (below) will be rolled over for 2022 specifications. Please refer
to last year’s stock assessment for details regarding the rolled over estimates. The grayed-out text
below summarizes the 2020 assessment.

*Changes from previous assessment*  
Estimated catches for 2019 and 2020 were updated and the 2020 acoustic-trawl survey biomass estimate
and preliminary 2020 survey age data were included. Two methods for computing the survey average are
provided: one using the random effects and the other using a simple 3-survey average, as in 2018. Natural
mortality was re-evaluated using the age-structured model presented in previous assessments (unchanged
except for new survey, fishery, and age composition data from the survey).

*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
NMFS acoustic-trawl survey biomass estimates are the primary data source used in this assessment.
Between 1997 and 2018, the values varied between a low of 67,063 t and a high of 663,070 t in 2018. The
most recent acoustic-trawl survey of the Bogoslof spawning stock was conducted in February 2020 and
resulted in a biomass estimate of 344,663 t. The random-effects method of survey averaging resulted in
378,662 t, compared to the three-survey average of 505,261 t.

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*   
The SSC has determined that this stock qualifies for management under Tier 5. The assessment authors and
the Team recommend that the maximum permissible ABC and OFL continue to be based on the randomeffects survey averaging approach. The assessment authors and the Team recommend using the biomass
estimate based on the random effects (378,262 t) for calculating the Tier 5 ABC.
The maximum permissible ABC value for 2021 is 85,109 t (assuming M = 0.3 and FABC = 0.75 x M = 0.225
and the random effects survey estimate for biomass). The ABC for 2022 is the same.

The OFL was calculated using the random effects estimate for the survey biomass. Following the Tier 5
formula with M=0.3, OFL for 2021 is 113,479 t. The OFL for 2022 is the same.

*Status determination*  
The walleye pollock stock in the Bogoslof district is not being subjected to overfishing. It is not possible to
determine whether this stock is overfished or whether it is approaching an overfished condition because it is managed under Tier 5.
