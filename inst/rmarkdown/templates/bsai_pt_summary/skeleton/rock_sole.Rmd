## 15. Northern rock sole

Status and catch specifications (t) of northern rock sole in recent years. 
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year. The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2` are those recommended by the Plan Team. 
Catch data are current through `r catch_data_date`.

*Changes from the previous assessment*  
In accordance with the approved schedule, a partial assessment was conducted for northern rock sole this
year. However, a full stock assessment will be conducted in 2022. The full assessment model was not rerun
but instead a Tier 1a projection model was run to estimate the stock level in future years using updated
2021 catches and assumed future catches. Catch projections for 2021 in the previous assessment were
assumed as a 10-year average of catch, whereas this year’s partial assessment used actual 2021 catches
which were ~2,000 t less than that projection. Please refer to last year’s stock assessment for details
regarding the rolled-over estimates.

*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
As estimated in last year’s assessment, spawning biomass was at a low in 2008, increased through the early
2010s, steadily decreased from 2015-2020, and models indicate a leveling off since then. Recruitment was
maintained at near historic lows for several years straight in the mid 2010s. More recently a pulse of recruits
has begun to show up in the surveys (see previous assessment). The stock assessment model projects a 2022
female spawning biomass of 287,600 t, similar to the previous 2022 female spawning biomass estimate of
286,381 t. The projected spawning biomass for 2023 is 320,399 t. Exploitation rates are relatively low and
catches are typically well below TAC’s.

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*  
The SSC has determined that northern rock sole qualifies for management under Tier 1. Spawning biomass
for 2022 is projected to be well above the BMSY estimate of 158,972, placing northern rock sole in sub-tier
“a” of Tier 1. The Tier 1 2022 and 2023 ABC harvest recommendations are 206,896 t and 271,199 t,
respectively (FABC = 0.152). The 2022 and 2023 OFLs are 214,084 t and 280,621 t (FOFL = 0.157).
Recommended ABCs correspond to the maximum permissible levels.

This is a stable fishery that lightly exploits the stock because it is constrained by PSC limits and the BSAI optimum yield cap. Usually the average catch/biomass ratio is about 3-4 percent.

*Status determination*  
Northern rock sole is not being subjected to overfishing, is not overfished, and is not approaching an
overfished condition.
