## 3. Sablefish

Status and catch specifications (t) of sablefish in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands in recent years.
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year.
The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2` are those recommended by the Plan Team. 
Beginning in the 2020 fishery year, the OFL was made Alaska-wide (i.e., for both BSAI and GOA FMPs combined). 
Catch data are current through `r catch_data_date`.


*Changes from the previous assessment*  
New data in the assessment model included relative abundance and length data from the 2021 longline
survey, length data from the fixed gear fishery for 2020, length data from the trawl fisheries for 2020, age
data from the longline survey and fixed gear fishery for 2020, updated catch for 2020, and projected 2021-
2023 catches. Estimates of killer and sperm whale depredation in the fishery were updated and projected
for 2021-2023. The 2021 NMFS Gulf of Alaska trawl survey extended the relative abundance indices and
length data for waters less than 500m and these were also used in the assessment. Due to funding issues
and timing constraints, 2020 fixed gear fishery catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data were unavailable (from
logbooks). Additionally, the proposed 2021 SAFE model (model 21.12) included revised estimates of
growth-, weight-, and maturity-at-age as reviewed during the September 2021 Plan Team meeting.

The authors recommended adoption of Model 21.12, which is identical to the model recommended at the
September Team meeting (Model 21.10), except that it uses an age-based GLM to estimate maturity without
incorporating information on skipped spawning. The Teams agreed with the authors’ choice of model.In
addition to updating biological information, the model removed the prior constraint on survey catchability.
Also, due to changes in the availability of smaller sablefish at depth, the model allowed for catchability and selectivity changes (in 2016) for the fixed gear fishery and selectivity in the longline survey. These changes improved model fits to the index data and the retrospective patterns. Finally, the composition data were reweighted so that the implied variances were more consistent with the model specification and other data
components.

*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
Survey abundance and biomass indices continued to increase in 2021. The longline survey abundance index
increased by 9% in 2021 following a 32% increase in 2020. The biennial trawl survey biomass index has
increased nearly five-fold since 2013, with a 40% increase from 2019 to 2021. The data and model indicate
strong year classes from 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018. Based on the strength of these recent year classes,
biomass estimates have more than doubled from a time series low of 215,000 t in 2015 to 553,000 t in 2021,
exceeding the highs of the mid-1980s. Spawning biomass is also increasing, but more gradually, since many
of these year classes are immature. The 2021 spawning biomass was estimated to be 36% of the B100% value.
Spawning biomass is projected to increase to B44% in 2022 and B51% in 2023 (contingent on the estimates of
young-fish abundance remaining strong).

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*  
Sablefish have been classified for management under Tier 3 of the FMP. Reference points were estimated
based on average recruitment from 1977 – 2017 and age-specific schedules of selectivity, weight, and
maturity. The B40% estimate was 118,140 t, and the projected 2022 spawning biomass of 128,789 t places
sablefish in sub-tier “a” of Tier 3. The updated point estimates of F40% and F35% from this assessment were 0.080 and 0.094, respectively. 
Thus, the maximum permissible value of FABC under Tier 3a is 0.080, which translates into a 2022 maximum permissible (and author recommended) ABC (combined areas) of 34,863 t. The OFL fishing mortality rate is 0.094, which translates into a 2022 OFL (combined areas) of 40,432 t.
Adjusting for estimated whale depredation, the 2022 combined areas ABC is 34,521 t. 
The Teams agreed
with these recommendations.

*Status determination*  
This stock is not being subjected to overfishing, is not overfished, and is not approaching an overfished
condition

*Area apportionment*  
In 2013, the Plan Team and SSC agreed that a fixed apportionment scheme was acceptable. In 2020,
results of a simulation analysis resulted in recommending a five-year average survey apportionment
method. The authors continue to recommend this approach and the Teams agreed. Last year, the SSC
recommended a phased transition to this method. This year, the authors noted that the SSC procedure
would mean a “50% stair step” from the 2019 fixed apportionment values towards the 2021 five-year
average survey apportionment. This gives the following area-specific ABCs (including deductions for
estimated whale depredation):
