## 20. Octopus  
Status and catch specifications (t) of octopus in recent years. 
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year. The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2` are those recommended by the Plan Team. 
Catch data are current through `r catch_data_date`.

*Changes from the previous assessment*  
The following new data were included in this yearâ€™s assessment:
1. Updated 2019 and preliminary 2020 incidental catch
2. Biomass estimates from the 2019 EBS shelf survey have been added. No relevant surveys were
conducted during 2020. 

Since the 2015 assessment, no changes have been made in the methodology for assessing octopus based on
consumption of octopus by Pacific cod. The consumption estimate using Pacific cod predation of octopus
as an estimator of biomass lost due to natural mortality first was accepted in 2011. New Pacific cod stomach
data through 2015 were added previously. Increases in both Pacific cod and percentage of octopus in Pacific
cod diet increased the annual consumption estimates from 2009-2015.

*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
Species composition and size frequencies from the surveys were similar to previous years. Survey biomass
estimates increased in 2019 for the EBS shelf survey when compared to 2018 estimates and the 2018
estimate decreased in the AI survey when compared to the 2016 estimate.
On the EBS shelf and in the commercial catch, giant Pacific octopus is the most abundant of at least nine
octopus species found in the BSAI. Octopuses are commonly caught in pot and trawl fisheries, especially
in the Pacific cod pot fishery. Trawl surveys sample octopus poorly, and biomass estimates from trawl
surveys are not considered reliable.

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*  
The ABC and OFL values were determined under Tier 6. Usually, Tier 6 specifications are based on average
catch, but starting in 2011, the assessment authors recommended setting harvest specifications using an
alternative mortality estimate based on species composition of Bering Sea Pacific cod diet from 1984-2008
survey data and weight-at-age data. This method was also recommended for 2017 and 2018 with additional
years from 1984-2015 of Pacific cod diet data based on the requested five-year review of Pacific cod diet
estimates. Data availability has not changed from the 2016 assessment, so harvest recommendations are the
same as in 2016. The recommended ABCs and OFLs for 2020 and 2021 are 3,576 t and 4,769 t,
respectively.

A risk table was completed for this stock with Level 1 ratings for all four categories and no adjustment to maxABC was proposed.

*Status determination*  
The octopus complex is not being subjected to overfishing. It is not possible to determine whether the
octopus complex is overfished or whether it is approaching an overfished condition because it is managed
under Tier 6.
