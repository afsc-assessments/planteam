## 13. Rougheye and blackspotted rockfish  
Status and catch specifications (t) of the blackspotted and rougheye rockfish complex in recent years. 
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year. The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2` are those recommended by the Plan Team. 
Catch data are current through `r catch_data_date`.

*Changes from the previous assessment*  
This assessment was changed to a biennial cycle beginning with the 2014 assessment; this is a partial
assessment year. Changes to the input data include catch data being updated for 2020 and revisions to the
2021 and 2022 catch estimates. There were no changes to the assessment methodology.

*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
Spawning biomass for AI blackspotted and rougheye rockfish in 2022 is projected to be 3,468 t and is
projected to increase slightly in 2023. 

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*  
The stock assessment is separated into AI and EBS. For the AI, this stock qualifies for management under
Tier 3 due to the availability of estimates for B40%, F40%, and F35%. Because the projected female spawning biomass for 2022 of 3,468 t is less than B40% (3,524 t), the stock qualifies as Tier 3b but is projected to slightly exceed B40% in 2023 (3,568 t). For the EBS, this stock is managed under Tier 5 with a projected biomass for both 2022 and 2023 of 1,371 t.

The authors and Team recommend an overall 2022 ABC of 503 t and a 2022 OFL of 598 t. The
apportionment of the 2022 ABC to subareas is 177 t for the Western and Central AI and 326 t for the Eastern AI and EBS

*Status determination*  
The BSAI blackspotted and rougheye stock complex is not being subjected to overfishing. For the AI
region, the blackspotted and rougheye rockfish complex is not overfished, and is not approaching an
overfished condition. It is not possible to determine whether the complex in the EBS region is overfished
or whether it is approaching an overfished condition because it is managed under Tier 5.


*Area apportionment*  
Ongoing concerns about fishing pressure relative to biomass in the Western Aleutians have been noted by
the Team. The maximum subarea species catch (MSSC) levels within the WAI/CAI, based on the random
effects model, are as follow:
