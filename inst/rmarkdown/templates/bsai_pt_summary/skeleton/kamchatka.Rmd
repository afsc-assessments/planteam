## 6. Kamchatka flounder  
Status and catch specifications (t) of Kamchatka flounder in recent years. 
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year. The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2` are those recommended by the Plan Team. 
Catch data are current through `r catch_data_date`.

*Changes from the previous assessment*  
In accordance with the approved schedule, this is an off-year for Kamchatka flounder and a partial
assessment was conducted. A full stock assessment will be conducted in 2022. No changes were made to
the assessment model methodology or inputs.
Changes to the projection data include:
1. The 2020 catch was reduced to 7,422 t from 7,427 t.
2. The 2021 catch input used in the projection model was set equal to 6,770 t. The 2021 catch was
estimated by expanding the catch as of October 8th by a factor of 1.0493. This expansion factor
represents the average proportion of catch after October 8th between 2016 and 2020.
3. The 2021 catch estimate was also used as the catch value for 2022 and 2023.


*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
The projected 2022 female spawning biomass is 55,701 t, above the B40% level of 40,550 t (which remained
constant), and spawning biomass is projected to remain above B40% for the foreseeable future. Last year’s
assessment noted that the early shelf survey size composition data suggest that some significant recruitment
events (assessed at age 2) occurred prior to 1991. Since 1991, the preferred assessment model (16.0b)
estimates that the 2001, 2002, 2008, and 2014 year classes are all at least 80% above average. Female
spawning biomass has been increasing since 2015. 

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*  
This stock was managed under Tier 3 for the first time in 2014. As noted above, projected spawning biomass
for 2022 is above B40%, placing Kamchatka flounder in sub-tier “a” of Tier 3. For the 2022 fishery, the
authors and Team recommend setting 2022 ABC at the maximum permissible value of 9,214 t from the
projection model. This value is an increase of 2.6% from the 2021 ABC currently specified (8,982 t). The
recommended 2022 OFL is 10,903 t, also a 2.6% increase from the 10,630 t currently specified for 2021

*Status determination*  
Kamchatka flounder is not being subjected to overfishing, is not overfished, and is not approaching an
overfished condition
