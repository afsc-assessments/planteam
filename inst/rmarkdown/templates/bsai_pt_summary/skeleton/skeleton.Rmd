## 1. Walleye pollock

Status and catch specifications (t) of walleye pollock in recent years.
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year.

## 18. Octopus

Status and catch specifications (t) of octopus stock complex in recent years. 
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year. 
The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2` are those recommended by the Plan Team. 
Catch data were through `r catch_data_date`. 

```{r octopus}
spp = "octopus"

df %>% 
  dplyr::filter(stock==spp, 
                year %in% (yr-1):(yr+2)) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(catch = dplyr::case_when(year > yr ~ NA,
                                         TRUE ~ catch),
                tac = dplyr::case_when(year>yr ~ NA,
                                       TRUE ~ tac),
                biomass = dplyr::case_when(year>yr+1 ~ NA,
                                           TRUE ~ biomass)) %>%
