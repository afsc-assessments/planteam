## 16. Other rockfish  
Status and catch specifications (t) of the other rockfish complex in recent years. 
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year. The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2` are those recommended by the Plan Team. 
Catch data are current through `r catch_data_date`.


```{r}
spp = c("other rockfish", "orox")

specs %>% 
  dplyr::filter(stock %in% spp) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(area = case_when(area=="BS" ~ "Eastern Bering Sea",
                                  area=="AI" ~ "Aleutian Islands",
                                  TRUE ~ area),
                 area = factor(area, 
                              levels = c("BSAI", "Eastern Bering Sea", "Aleutian Islands"))) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = measure, values_from = value) -> specs2
  
sum_tbl_bs(spp, bio, specs2) %>% 
  flextable::hline(i=c(4,8))
```

*Changes from the previous assessment*  
A full stock assessment was conducted this year.
Changes to the input data:
1. Catch and fishery lengths updated through October 13, 2020.
2. The only new survey biomass for this assessment is a zero biomass observation for non-SST
species in the 2019 Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) shelf survey. The 2020 AI and EBS shelf
surveys were canceled due to Covid-19, and there has been no EBS slope survey since 2016.
3. Following guidance from the Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division
(RACE) division, survey biomass inputs to the random effects (RE) model were limited to:
AI (1991-present), EBS shelf (1982-present), and EBS slope (2002-present). 

There were no changes in the assessment methodology. 

*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
This is a Tier 5 complex, thus trends in spawning biomass are unknown. The random effects survey biomass
estimates for shortspine thornyhead (SST) in the Aleutian Islands and EBS slope have been variable. The
non-SST portion of the complex varies dramatically among surveys, although there was no survey this year.
Biomass estimates are frequently zero or very small for the non-SST portion of the complex in both the
eastern Bering Sea slope and shelf surveys.

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*  
The Team agrees with the approach recommended by the author of setting FABC at the maximum allowable
under Tier 5 (FABC = 0.75M). The accepted values of M for species in this complex are 0.03 for SST and
0.09 for all other species. Multiplying these rates by the best biomass estimates of shortspine thornyhead
and the non-SST portion of the complex yields 2021 and 2022 ABCs of 919 t in the eastern Bering Sea and
394 t in the Aleutian Islands. The Team recommends that OFL be set for the entire BSAI area, which under
Tier 5 is calculated by multiplying the best estimates of total biomass for the area by the separate natural
mortality values and adding the results, yielding an OFL of 1,751 t for 2021 and 2022.

*Status determination*  
The other rockfish complex is not being subjected to overfishing. 
It is not possible to determine whether this complex is overfished or whether it is approaching an overfished condition because it is managed under Tier 5.
