## 9. Pacific ocean perch  
Status and catch specifications (t) of Pacific ocean perch in recent years. 
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year. The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2` are those recommended by the Plan Team. 
Catch data are current through `r catch_data_date`.

*Changes from the previous assessment*  
In accordance with the approved schedule, a partial assessment was conducted for Pacific ocean perch
this year. In a partial assessment year, the full assessment model is not rerun but instead a Tier 3
projection model with an assumed future catch is run to estimate the stock level in future years. This
incorporates the most current catch information without re-estimating model parameters and biological
reference points. Changes to the input data include updated 2020 catch and estimated 2021-2022 catches.
There were no changes to the assessment methodology. 

*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
Spawning biomass is projected to be lower in 2022 than in 2021 and decline in 2023. Last year’s
assessment estimated that exploitation rates (i.e., catch/biomass) have averaged 0.030 from 2004-2021,
which is below the exploitation rate associated with fishing at F40%. Exploitation rates from the BSAI
subareas are similar to the overall BSAI exploitation rates, with the exception of low exploitation rates in the EBS area in the early 2000s and in recent years in the western Aleutians. The similarity in exploitation rates between areas is expected because BSAI POP are managed with subarea ABCs based on the spatial distribution of survey biomass.

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*  
The SSC has determined that reliable estimates of B40%, F40%, and F35% exist for this stock, thereby
qualifying POP for management under Tier 3. The updated point estimates of B40%, F40%, and F35% are
233,899 t, 0.073, and 0.089, respectively. Given that the projected spawning biomass for 2022 (299,232 t)
exceeds B40%, ABC and OFL recommendations for 2022 were calculated under the sub-tier “a” of Tier 3. 
The maximum permissible value of FABC under Tier 3a is 0.073, which results in the author and Plan
Team recommended 2022 ABC of 35,688 t and 2023 ABC of 34,322 t. The OFL fishing mortality rate is
0.089, which results in a 2022 OFL of 42,605 t and 2023 OFL of 40,977 t.

*Status determination*  
This stock is not being subjected to overfishing, is not overfished, and is not approaching an overfished
condition.

*Area apportionment*  
The Team agreed with the author’s recommendation that ABCs be set regionally based on the proportions
of combined survey biomass as follows (values are for 2022): EBS = 10,352 t, Eastern Aleutians (Area
541) = 8,083 t, Central Aleutians (Area 542) = 5,950 t, and Western Aleutians (Area 543) = 11,303 t. The
recommended OFLs for 2022 and 2023 are not regionally apportioned.
