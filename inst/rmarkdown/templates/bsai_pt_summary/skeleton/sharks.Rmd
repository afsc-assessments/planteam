## 19. Sharks  
Status and catch specifications (t) of sharks in recent years. 
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year. The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2` are those recommended by the Plan Team. 
Catch data are current through `r catch_data_date`.

*Changes from the previous assessment*  
This assessment was changed to a biennial cycle beginning with the 2014 assessment; this is a full
assessment.
Changes to the input data in this analysis include:
1. Total catch for BSAI sharks is updated for 2003–2020 (as of Oct 13, 2020).
2. International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) longline survey relative population numbers
(RPNs) are updated through 2019.
3. Biomass estimates have been updated for the Bering Sea shelf trawl survey through 2019 (no
surveys were conducted in 2020).
There were no changes in the assessment methodology. 

*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
The main shark species taken in the BSAI fisheries (mainly pollock and Pacific cod) are Pacific sleeper
sharks and salmon sharks. Beginning around 2000, catch rates of sleeper sharks in both the IPHC longline
survey and the bycatch fisheries declined steeply for several years, causing possible concern about
depletion. In 2017, the IPHC RPN showed a slight increase, which was the first increase in a decade. All
sleeper sharks taken in the survey and fisheries are likely juveniles, so it is impossible to know what effect
those catches have on spawning stock biomass. Bycatch of salmon sharks has generally increased since
2010. Recent catch levels have been well below the ABC.


*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*  
The SSC has placed sharks in Tier 6, where OFL and ABC are typically based on historical catches. The
OFL is fixed at the maximum catch during 2003–2015 (689 t) and ABC at 75% of OFL, 517 t.


*Status determination*  
The shark complex is not being subjected to overfishing. It is not possible to determine whether this species complex is overfished or whether it is approaching an overfished condition because it is managed under Tier 6.
