## 12. Other flatfish complex  
Status and catch specifications (t) of the other flatfish complex in recent years. 
Biomass for each year corresponds to the projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year. The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2` are those recommended by the Plan Team. 
Catch data are current through `r catch_data_date`.

*Changes from the previous assessment*  
This stock is managed on a four-year cycle and 2021 was an off year. Therefore there was no update to
this assessment. 
The last full assessment was in 2020 and the next full assessment is scheduled for 2024.

*Spawning biomass and stock trends*  
EBS shelf survey biomass estimates for this complex were all below 100,000 t from 1983-2003, and reached
a high of 150,480 t in 2006. This is a not-targeted species complex and in 2019 approximately 23% of the
ABC was caught. The random effects model estimates indicate that the other flatfish species group is at a
high level relative to the time series average and is lightly exploited.

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*  
The SSC has classified other flatfish as a Tier 5 species complex with harvest recommendations calculated
from estimates of biomass and natural mortality. Natural mortality rates for rex (0.17) and Dover sole
(0.085) borrowed from the Gulf of Alaska are used, along with a value of 0.15 for all other species in the
complex. The resultant 2022 OFL and ABC are 22,919 t and 17,189 t respectively. 

*Status determination*  
This assemblage is not being subjected to overfishing. It is not possible to determine whether this
assemblage is overfished or whether it is approaching an overfished condition because it is managed under
Tier 5.
