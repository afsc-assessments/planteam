## 1. Walleye pollock

Status and catch specifications (t) of pollock and projections for
`r year+1` and `r year+2`. Biomass for each year corresponds to the
projection given in the SAFE report issued in the preceding year. The
biomass is reported as age 3+ for eastern Bering Sea, age 2+ for the
Aleutian Islands and the survey biomass for Bogoslof, as reported in the
respective assessments. The OFL and ABC for `r year+1` and `r year+2`
are those recommended by the Plan Team. Catch data were through
`r catch_data_date`.

### Eastern Bering Sea pollock

#### Changes from previous assessment

New data in this year's assessment include the following: 1. Observer
data for catch-at-age and average weight-at-age from the 2020 fishery
were finalized and included. 2. Total catch as reported by NMFS Alaska
Regional office was updated and included through 2021. 3. VAST estimates
of the combined EBS and NBS survey biomass index were updated and
included through 2021. 4. The AVO index for 2021 was included. 5. Length
composition from the 2021 fishery and a preliminary estimate of the age
composition from the 2021 fishery were included. The authors' and Team's
recommended model for setting harvest specifications is Model 20.0c,
which is a minor modification of last year's model (20.0a) in that, in
addition to the typical data updates, it includes fishery length
composition and preliminary fishery age composition data from the
current year. Spawning biomass and stock trends Spawning biomass in 2008
was at the lowest level since 1980 but had increased by a factor of 2.30
by 2017, and has since started trending downward again. The 2008 low was
the result of extremely poor recruitments from the 2002-2005 year
classes. Recent increases were fueled by recruitment from the very
strong 2008, 2012, and 2013 year classes (above average by factors of
2.10, 1.93, and 2.04 for the post-1976 time series, respectively), along
with spawning exploitation rates at or below 20% from 2008 through 2018.
Spawning biomass is projected to be 15% below BMSY in 2022. Tier
determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs The SSC
has determined that EBS pollock qualifies for management under Tier 1
because there are reliable estimates of BMSY and the probability density
function for FMSY. The updated estimate of BMSY from the present
assessment is 2.220 million t. Projected spawning biomass for 2022 is
1.881 million t, placing EBS walleye pollock in sub-tier "b" of Tier 1.
As has been the approach for many years, the maximum permissible ABC
harvest rate was based on the ratio between MSY and the equilibrium
biomass corresponding to MSY. The harmonic mean of this ratio from the
present assessment, after adjusting according to the sloping portion of
the harvest control rule, is 0.334. The harvest ratio of 0.334 is
multiplied by the geometric mean of the projected fishable biomass for
2022 (3.750 million t) to obtain the maximum permissible ABC for 2022,
which is 1.251 million t. However, as with other recent EBS pollock
assessments, the authors recommend setting ABCs well below the maximum
permissible levels. Their reasons for doing so are listed in the "ABC
Recommendation" section of the SAFE chapter, where all categories in the
risk table are scored as Level 2 ("substantially increased concern").
The authors conclude that these levels of concern warrant setting the
2022 and 2023 ABCs at 1,111,000 t and 1,289,000 t (reductions of 11%
from the corresponding maxABC in both cases), which are the values
associated with the Tier 2 maxABC harvest control rule (use of the Tier
2 rule was suggested by the SSC at the October 2021 meeting). This is a
change from the harvest policy that has been recommended by both the
Team and SSC for the EBS pollock stock since the 2014 assessment cycle,
which was to base the reduction on the Tier 3 maxABC harvest control
rule. As the authors note, the ratio between the maxABC values resulting
from the Tier 1 and Tier 2 harvest control rules is likely to be much
less variable than the ratio between the Tier 1 and Tier 3 values. The
authors also note that the Tier 2 maxABC for 2022 is extremely close to
the value that would be obtained by maintaining fishing effort at the
current level, which is another strategy that has been used by the Team
in the past. The Team concurs with the authors' recommendation to base
ABC for the 2022 and 2023 fisheries on the Tier 2 maxABC harvest control
rule. The OFL harvest ratio under Tier 1b is 0.392, corresponding to the
arithmetic mean of the ratio between MSY and the equilibrium fishable
biomass corresponding to MSY, after adjusting according to the sloping
portion of the harvest control rule. The product of this ratio and the
geometric mean of the projected fishable biomass for 2022 determines the
OFL for 2022, which is 1.469 million t. Given a projected 2022 catch of
1.200 million t, the current projection for OFL in 2023 is 1.704 million
t. \#### Status determination The walleye pollock stock in the EBS is
not being subjected to overfishing, is not overfished, and is not
approaching an overfished condition.

### Aleutian Islands pollock

#### Changes from previous assessment

There were no changes made to the assessment model inputs since this was
an off-cycle year. New data added to the projection model included an
updated 2020 catch estimate (3,205 t) and new catch estimates for 2021.
The 2022 catch was set at the 3 year average for 2018-2020 of 2,243 t.
There were no changes in assessment methodology since this was an
off-cycle year.

#### Spawning biomass and stock trends

Last year's assessment estimated that spawning biomass reached a minimum
level of about B27% in 2010, but has increased every year since,
reaching a level of about B49% in 2020, with a slight projected decline
to about B46% for 2021. Although nearly all of the cohorts spawned after
2008 have tended to be stronger than nearly all of the cohorts spawned
between 1994 and 2008, and the 2011-2015 cohorts are all above the
median value, there have been no above-average cohorts spawned since
1989 (the average is much higher than the median, due to the fact that
the 1978 year class was larger than the average of the other year
classes by a factor of about 16.7).

#### Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs

The official total catch for 2020 is 3,205 t which is a small fraction
of the 2020 OFL of 66,973 t; therefore, the stock is not being subjected
to overfishing. The estimates of spawning biomass for 2021 and 2022 from
last year's assessment model (Barbeaux et al. 2020) and the current year
(2021) projection model are 89,906 t and 85,785 t, respectively. The
2021 estimate from the current year projection is above B35% at 64,916 t
and the 2022 estimate is above ½ B35% and the stock is expected to be
above B35% in 2033 under projection Scenario 7, therefore, the stock is
not currently overfished nor approaching an overfished condition.

For the 2022 fishery, the Team recommends the maximum allowable ABC of
50,752 t and OFL of 61,263 t from the updated projection model.
Projections assumed estimated catches of 1,656 t for 2021 and 2,243 t
for 2022, the three-year average (2018- 2020), used in place of maximum
permissible ABC. Status determination The walleye pollock stock in the
Aleutian Islands is not being subject to overfishing, is not currently
overfished, nor is it approaching a condition of being overfished. \###
Bogoslof pollock In accordance with the approved schedule, no assessment
was conducted for Bogoslof pollock this year. However, a full stock
assessment will be conducted in 2022. Until then, the values generated
from the previous stock assessment (below) will be rolled over for 2022
specifications. Please refer to last year's stock assessment for details
regarding the rolled over estimates. The grayed-out text below
summarizes the 2020 assessment.

#### Changes from previous assessment

Estimated catches for 2019 and 2020 were updated and the 2020
acoustic-trawl survey biomass estimate and preliminary 2020 survey age
data were included. Two methods for computing the survey average are
provided: one using the random effects and the other using a simple
3-survey average, as in 2018. Natural mortality was re-evaluated using
the age-structured model presented in previous assessments (unchanged
except for new survey, fishery, and age composition data from the
survey).

#### Spawning biomass and stock trends

NMFS acoustic-trawl survey biomass estimates are the primary data source
used in this assessment. Between 1997 and 2018, the values varied
between a low of 67,063 t and a high of 663,070 t in 2018. The most
recent acoustic-trawl survey of the Bogoslof spawning stock was
conducted in February 2020 and resulted in a biomass estimate of 344,663
t. The random-effects method of survey averaging resulted in 378,662 t,
compared to the three-survey average of 505,261 t.

#### Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs

The SSC has determined that this stock qualifies for management under
Tier 5. The assessment authors and the Team recommend that the maximum
permissible ABC and OFL continue to be based on the random-effects
survey averaging approach. The assessment authors and the Team recommend
using the biomass estimate based on the random effects (378,262 t) for
calculating the Tier 5 ABC. The maximum permissible ABC value for 2021
is 85,109 t (assuming M = 0.3 and FABC = 0.75 x M = 0.225 and the random
effects survey estimate for biomass). The ABC for 2022 is the same. The
OFL was calculated using the random effects estimate for the survey
biomass. Following the Tier 5 formula with M=0.3, OFL for 2021 is
113,479 t. The OFL for 2022 is the same.

#### Status determination

The walleye pollock stock in the Bogoslof district is not being
subjected to overfishing. It is not possible to determine whether this
stock is overfished or whether it is approaching an overfished condition
because it is managed under Tier 5.

*Changes from the previous assessment* This year's pollock assessment
features the following new data: 1) 2020 total catch and catch-at-age
from the fishery, 2) 2021 biomass and age composition from the Shelikof
Strait acoustic survey, 3) 2021 NMFS Bottom Trawl survey biomass and
length composition, 4) 2021 Summer GOA-wide acoustic survey biomass and
length composition, and 5) 2021 biomass and 2020 age composition from
the ADF&G crab/groundfish trawl survey. The age-structured assessment
model used for GOA W/C/WYAK pollock assessment was identical to the 2019
and 2020 assessments (Model 19.1).

*Spawning biomass and stock trends* The spawning stock is projected to
continue to decline slightly in 2022 and 2023 as the 2012 year class is
further reduced in abundance, however with new fish recruited into the
fishery, spawning biomass is projected to start increasing in 2025. The
presence of several incoming year classes should result in a
stabilization in biomass. However, the 2021 Shelikof Strait survey
showed an unexpected reduction in the estimated abundance of the 2018
year class (aged 3) relative to their abundance in the 2019 survey. The
2017 year-class (aged 4) is still present in high numbers, and a strong
new 2020 class was detected in all surveys. Overall, the Shelikof Strait
survey data in 2021 showed a similar biomass to 2020. Overall, survey
indices seem to be providing similar trends with closer agreement with
the ADF&G survey, as well as the 2021 NMFS bottom trawl survey results.
An exception to this was the acoustic summer survey, which was 25%
percent lower than the 2019 estimate.

*Tier determination/Plan Team discussion and resulting ABCs and OFLs*
The model projection of female spawning biomass in 2022 is 186,481,
which is above B40% (172,000), which places the W/C/WYAK Gulf of Alaska
pollock stock in Tier 3a. The model estimated 2022 age-3+ biomass is
1,097,340 t (for the W/C/WYAK areas) which was similar to the 2020
estimate (1,007,850 t). The author scored the current risk conditions as
Level 1 for all four risk categories, and thus did not recommend a
reduction from maximum permissible ABC. The Team supported the authors'
recommendation using the assessment-derived maximum permissible ABC for
2022. The resulting 2022 ABC for pollock in the Gulf of Alaska west of
140° W longitude (W/C/WYAK) is 133,081 t which is a 26 % increase from
the 2021 ABC. The OFL is 154,983 t for 2022. The 2021 Prince William
Sound (PWS) GHL is 3,327t (2.5% of the W/C/WYAK ABC). Pollock in
southeast Alaska (East Yakutat and Southeastern areas) are in Tier 5.
The recommended ABC is 11,363 t for 2022 and 2023, which is an increase
of 12% from the 2020 ABC. These recommendations are based on natural
mortality (0.3) and the random effects model fit to the 1990-2021 bottom
trawl survey biomass estimates in Southeast Alaska.

*Status determination* The Gulf of Alaska pollock stock is not being
subjected to overfishing and is neither overfished nor approaching an
overfished condition.

*Area apportionment* The assessment was updated to include the most
recent data available for area apportionments within each season
(Appendix 1D.3 of the GOA pollock chapter). For winter seasons, model
estimates of biomass for winter acoustic surveys conducted were used as
a basis for apportionment. pportionments for the B1 and B2 seasons were
based on a 3-year weighted average of the sum of the AFSC bottom trawl
survey and the gulf-wide acoustic summer survey (unchanged from the
previous assessment). Area apportionments, including the 2.5% of the ABC
for the State of Alaska managed pollock fishery in Prince William Sound,
are as follows:
